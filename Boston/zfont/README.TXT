1.INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Together with this file, you should have also the following files:

ZFONT.TTF - TrueType Font with symbols of Z language
ZFONT.PS  - character map which can be printed on PostScript printers
ZFONT.HP2 - character map which can be printed on HP LaserJet II Plus 
            or more advanced HP Laser Jet printers
ZTEXT.DOT - a document template for WinWord 2.0


2.INSTALLATION OF Z FONT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In MS Windows Program Managers's Main window double-click on
Control Panel icon.
In Control Panel double click on Fonts.
Press "Add...".
In "Directories:" list box, find the directory with Z Font.
In "List of Fonts:" select "Z Font Regular (TrueType Font)".
Press "OK".
Press "Close".


3.USING ZTEXT.DOT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use ZTEXT.DOT to type your documents you must first
copy it to the directory where your WinWord is installed (You should
see more .DOT files in this directory).

To use ZTEXT.DOT within your WinWord, in File menu select "New...".
In the window which appears in "Use Template:" box select ZTEXT
and press "OK".

Two empty schema boxes appear in the WinWord main window. You can
use Copy&Paste system to produce other schema boxes or extend these
ones.

Within ZTEXT.DOT you can find the styles `Z Schema' and `Z Schema1'
which can be used to comfortably write Z schemas. If you use Z Font 
in combination with other fonts of different sizes, the schema boxes 
might not appear as continuous lines, the `Z Schema1' style will keep 
the schema boxes "in one piece". Two schema boxes in ZTEXT.DOT are written
in `Z Schema1' style.

In ZTEXT.DOT, you can switch between various fonts using the following
shortcut keys:
Ctrl+Shift+Z: Z Font (Regular)
Ctrl+Shift+T: Times New Roman (Regular)
Ctrl+Shift+I: Times New Roman Italic
Ctrl+Shift+A: Arial (Regular) 

Styles can be applied using these shorcut keys:
Ctrl+Shift+1: Z Schema1
Ctrl+Shift+2: Z Schema
Other styles can be chosen in the first box of the WinWord ribbon.

Use Character Map program from Acessories to see how particular
Z symbols can be typed.


4.PRINTING CHARACTER MAPS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To print ZFONT.PS on PostScript printer or ZFONT.HP2 on HP Laser Jet II Plus
or more advanced HP Laser Jet printers, type in the DOS-prompt:

copy /b zfont.ps prn
copy /b zfont.hp2 prn
