FAMOUS2 Copyright:

As part of its semantic modelling for semantic interoperability research, the European
Space Agency has given the task of developing the "Fact Based Modelling Unifying
System" (FAMOUS) methodology to the PNA Group supported by Terence Halpin. The
FAMOUS-2 specification (including formal models) is the first output from this ESA
research.

The FAMOUS-2 consortium (including ESA, PNA Group and Terence Halpin) are keen
that the FAMOUS-2 specification becomes widely used, as many existing information
modelling standards are far less effective, especially when taking into account the
information modelling at a “global level” required by Large Systems Developments and
Operations. Therefore, the FAMOUS-2 consortium decided to release the FAMOUS-2
specification under a permissive license as specified here below:
