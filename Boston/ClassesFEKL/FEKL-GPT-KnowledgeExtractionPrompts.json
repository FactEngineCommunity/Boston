      "Prompt": "The following are what is known as FEKL Statements. They are used to define a conceptual schema.\r\n\r\n==============Examples==============\r\nCinema IS A CONCEPT\r\nFilm IS AN ENTITY TYPE\r\nSatellite IS A CONCEPT\r\nSatellite HAS LONG DESCRIPTION \"A body that orbits a planet\"\r\nPerson IS AN ENTITY TYPE\r\nSection IS AN ENTITY TYPE\r\nCinema IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Id\r\nFilm IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Id\r\nPerson IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Id\r\nSection IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Name\r\nRow IS WHERE Cinema has RowNr\r\nSeat IS WHERE Cinema has RowNr has Letter\r\nAdult IS A KIND OF Person\r\nTeenager IS A KIND OF Person\r\nChild IS A KIND OF Person\r\nSession IS WHERE Film has DateTime has Cinema\r\nSession IS OBJECTIFIED\r\nSession IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Film, DateTime, Cinema\r\nBooking IS WHERE Person has Session\r\nBooking IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Person, Session\r\nBooking IS OBJECTIFIED\r\nBookingHasSeat IS WHERE Booking has Seat\r\nBookingHasSeat IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Booking, Seat\r\nCinema has AT MOST ONE CinemaName\r\nFilm has AT MOST ONE Name\r\nCompany HAS LONG DESCRIPTION \"A commercial business\"\r\nPerson has AT MOST ONE Age\r\nPerson has AT MOST ONE DateOfBirth\r\nPerson has ONE LoginName\r\nSeat has AT MOST ONE Section_Name\r\nRow IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Cinema, RowNr\r\nSeat IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Row, Letter\r\nSeat references Section\r\n==============End of Examples================\r\n==============Training==========================\r\nBackground for you to learn from:\r\n\r\nFEKL is used to define Object Types/Entities, Relationships (with predicates), and Constraints.\r\n\r\n- The FEKL Statement, \"Person IS A CONCEPT\", is for the keyword, Person;\r\n- The FEKL Statement, \"Cinema IS AN ENTITY TYPE\", is for the keyword, Cinema;\r\n- The FEKL Statement, \"Seat references Section\" is for a relationship;\r\n- The FEKL Statement, \"Person IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Id\" is for entity identification;\r\n- The FEKL Statement, \"Seat has AT MOST ONE Section Name\" is a non-mandatory many to one relationship;\r\n- The sentence: Each cinema subservice shall have at least one row, resolves to the FEKL Statement, \"Cinema has AT LEAST ONE Row\";\r\n- The sentence: Each person travels to at most one city, resolves to the FELK Statement, \"Person travels to AT MOST ONE City\";\r\n- The sentence: \"Each film shall be uniquely identified by exactly one film id\", resolves to \"Film IS IDENTIFIED BY ITS Id\";\r\n- The sentence: \"Each film has one film name\", resolves to \"Film has ONE Film Name\";\r\n- The sentence: \"Child is a subtype of person\" resolves to \"Child IS A KIND OF Person\";\r\n- The sentence: \"Person has subclass teenager\" resolves to \"Teenager IS A KIND OF Person\"\r\n- The sentence: \"Person has property, LoginName\" resolves to \"Person has AT MOST ONE Login Name\";\r\n- The sentence: \"Session is described as Cinema is showing Film on DateTime\" resolves to \"Session IS WHERE Cinema is showing Film on Date Time\".\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: For keywords/entity names, use Pascal Case with a space between words. E.g. \"First Name\".\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:  Remember \"Name\" is rarely used on its own. When you have to use \"Name\", pair it with the entity name, \"<Entity Name> Name\". e.g. \"Company Name\". E.g. \"Company has ONE Company Name\", or \"Person has AT MOST ONE Middle Name\".\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Restrict \"IS WHERE\" type FEKL Statements to ternary or greater relationships, not binary relationships. E.g \"Person has First Name\" is a binary relationship, \"Session IS WHERE Cinema is showing Film on Date Time\" is a ternary relationship.\r\n\r\nHint: You can use coreference, to pull FEKL Statements from between sentences;\r\nHint: \"Person has firstName\" resolves to \"Peron has First Name\";\r\nHint: Remember to pull descriptions into a \"HAS LONG DESCRIPTION\" FEKL Statements where you can.\r\n\r\n- All Keywords are in Pascal Case, with a space betwen words;\r\n- All predicates are in lowercase (e.g. 'has','is in');\r\nIMPORTANT: Remember to get as many \"LONG DESCRIPTION\" FEKL Statements as possible.\r\n==============End of Training===================\r\n\r\n==============Your Task===================\r\nYou are a world class Business Analyst, doing FEKl Statement knowledge extraction from the following text to create a conceptual schema.\r\n- Only return the FEKL Statements from the text below.\r\n- Analyse and extract FEKL Statements for keywords, concept classification, entity type definition, entity type identification, descriptions, subtypes and relationships from only the text below:\r\nHeres the text to analyse:"
