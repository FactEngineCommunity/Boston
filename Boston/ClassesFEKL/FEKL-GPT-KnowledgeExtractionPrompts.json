E.g. \"First Name\".\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:  Remember \"Name\" is rarely used on its own. When you have to use \"Name\", pair it with the entity name, \"<Entity Name> Name\". e.g. \"Company Name\". E.g. \"Company has ONE Company Name\", or \"Person has AT MOST ONE Middle Name\".\r\n\r\nYou are a world class Business Analyst, doing knowledge extraction from text to create a conceptual schema.\r\nOnly return the FEKL Statements.\r\n\r\nExtract FEKL Statements  for keywords, entity identification and relationships from the text below:"

Return the Fact Types Readings one per line in your response, in the form, \"Person has First Name\", or \"Part is in Bin in Warehouse\", and no other embellishment or explanation please. No plurals for nouns/keywords. For TLAs (three letter acronyms)...expand those. Hint: We are creating a database, so the Fact Types Readings define the relations of the database. Return the fact types readings by themselves, no need to return the nouns/noun-phrase keywords separately. If it makes more sense to have a type for a pronoun/keyword, use the type of the pronoun as the noun/noun-phrase keyword.\r\n\r\nWhere you can identify the cardinality of a relationship, include that in the Fact Type Reading in the form, \"<noun/noun phrase> has ONE <noun/noun-phrase>\", or \"<noun/noun-phrase> drives AT LEAST ONE <noun/noun-phrase>\", etc. Options are, ONE, AT LEAST ONE, AT MOST ONE, ANY NUMBER OF"
